Abstract
Multithreading is a vital part of any software applications today. It provides a mechanism to break up a program into multiple parts and execute concurrently. This enables the utilization of the full computing benefits of multi-processor and multi-core systems. However, breaking up a job into multiple threads for parallel execution, also poses a unique set of challenges. Developers need to make vital decisions such as how to break up the tasks and data, how to address dependencies between the tasks and so on. Additionally, creating multiple threads does not automatically guarantee better performance. There are several factors which govern performance in a multithreaded application:
1. The nature of the job to be executed. All algorithms are not suitable for parallelization.
2. The percentage of task which can be run in parallel. For some applications, a significant portion of the functionality may be executed in parallel. For some others, the bulk of the functionality may involve operations like I/O which do not benefit from multithreading.
